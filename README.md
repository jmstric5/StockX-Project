# StockX-Project
This details the work from my side project using StockX Kaggle competition (2019) data to look at the differences and similarities in attributes between Yeezy and Off-White sneakers. The first couple questions that came to my mind upon looking through this data were:
1. What states are purchasing the most shoes?
2. Is it better to hold onto shoes for longer or sell them right away?
3. What shoes have had the greatest sale to retail price?

To help answer some of these preliminary questions, I created a Tableau dashboard using the data given plus a few engineered features. You can view this dashboard at: https://public.tableau.com/profile/jordan3657#!/vizhome/StockXDashboard/StockXDashboard
